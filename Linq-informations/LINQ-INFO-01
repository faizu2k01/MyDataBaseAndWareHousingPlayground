Introduction of LINQ -

LINQ stands for Language integrated query, used in .net framework to write db queries in .net programming languages.
ORM's used to convert the LINQ into SQL to perfome the query operations on the db when needed.


How the three parts of query operation executes?
Most of the database query operations are divided into three operational parts that are as follows -

1- Initilization, 2- Execution, 3- Enumeration

A- Initilization - Also defined and DIFINITION of query. in this part the query used to be written and structurized, carried out as 
value for the variables.

E.G. -
var query  = (FROM item IN Table_Name WHERE Conditons SELECT values)

B- Execution - With Extention methods or for loops, the query execution takes place and applies the query on the db to perform the 
operation.
E.G. - 
(for item in query){} or query.ToList() or query.FirstOrDefault()

C- Enumeration - Iteration part of the data. utilized loop to iterate through each record of the result.
